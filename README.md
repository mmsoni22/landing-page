## About Project
This is udacity's front end web developer course's second project.
They provided HTML and CSS starter code and I have to change in app.js file to 
make page dynamic.
This project requires student to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
